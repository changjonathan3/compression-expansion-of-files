Additional comments to the grader:
The bottom half of newly expanded large.txt has different words than 
the original. But it's the same size as the original large.txt file.
The storing in the codebook might be messed up at a very large size.
It was hard to tell exactly since the smaller files did not have any
differences than their originals.
